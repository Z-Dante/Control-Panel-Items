# Back-to-Start
Just all control panel items. Nothing more. Might be a quick and dirty fix to search for classic control panel items right from the start menu by copying the entire folder to ` C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\`
Also works with custom start menu programs like StartIsBack/StartAllBack and launchers like Windows Powertoys Run
