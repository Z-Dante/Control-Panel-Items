## Add Classic Control Panel Items Back to Start / Search

Just all control panel items. Nothing more. Might be a quick and dirty fix to search for classic control panel items right from the start menu by copying the entire folder to ` C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\`
Also works with custom start menu programs like StartIsBack/StartAllBack and launchers like Windows Powertoys Run. 
Tested on Windows 11

Run Quck-install.bat as admin to add to start menu automatically

Similarly run Quck-uninstall.bat to remove the added items
